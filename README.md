# WIP - Pra2do

Pra2do is a creative coding DSL for Prolog. Create interactive 2D graphics in Prolog. Currently, Pra2do requires a _terminal_, which is a program that has access to the graphics. Prolog will send data to the terminal over a socket to draw.

_MORE INFO SOON_

TODO:

* Canvas 2D HTML5 like API
* Improve metaintrepeter so Socket does not need to be pased.
* Improve State handling
